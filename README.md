lnotify.py
=======

Personal modifications to the WeeChat lnotify.py script.

Supports:
 * Highlighting messages through the use of watch words, private messages, nick mentions.
 * Sound notifications through the use of aplay (by default) and a custom file.
 * Blacklisting nicks that shouldn't trigger a notification.
 * Support for irssi notifications to integrate with android devices.
 * Configurable icon for libnotify.
 * Disabling of notifications when you are "away".
 * Disabling notifications for the channel in the current buffer.

This runs well for me locally with WeeChat, but forks and pull requests are gladly accepted.
